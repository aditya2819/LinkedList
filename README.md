# Singly Linked List Python Implementation

This Python code provides an implementation of a singly linked list and demonstrates various operations on it. A singly linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in a sequence, and each element points to the next element in the list.

## Features

The provided code includes the following features and operations for a singly linked list:

1. **Node Class**:
   - The `Node` class represents a single node in the linked list. It contains data and a reference to the next node.

2. **Singly Linked List Class**:
   - The `LinkedList` class represents the singly linked list. It includes the following operations:
     - **Insertion at the Beginning**: Add an element to the beginning of the list.
     - **Insertion at the End**: Add an element to the end of the list.
     - **Insertion at a Specific Index**: Add an element at a specific index.
     - **Deletion from the Beginning**: Remove the first element from the list.
     - **Deletion from the End**: Remove the last element from the list.
     - **Deletion at a Specific Index**: Remove an element at a specific index.
     - **Deletion by Value**: Remove an element with a specific value.
     - **Updating an Element at a Specific Index**: Modify an element at a specific index.
     - **Updating an Element by Value**: Modify an element by its value.
     - **Printing the Linked List**: Display the elements in the linked list.
     - **Returning Value at a Specific Index**: Retrieve the value at a specific index.
     - **Returning Index of a Specific Value**: Find the index of a specific value.
     - **Getting the Size of the Linked List**: Calculate the number of elements in the list.

## Usage

You can use this code to create a singly linked list, insert elements, perform various operations, and retrieve information about the list.
# Perform operations on the list, such as printing, deleting, updating, and more
# Example test cases and expected outputs are provided in the test.py code.
